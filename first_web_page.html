        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The definition of a Sandwich is when you have two pieces of bread and meat and a cheese. this is the google definition of a Sandwich. I find that a Sandwich is much more it is a satifaction. A way to have a break. Just the way the Sandwich bread sticks to the top of your mouth, the meat juices falling on your tung. MMMMMMMM. Looking at a Sandwich you just know that it is the American dream, people come to this country to try our sandwiches they are not just a bread and a patty, but America itself.</p>

        <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I find that a Hot Dog is not a sandwich. Just look at the facts, it does not have the same satifaction that a Sandwich would and it does not have the bread sensations that a normal Sandwich would have. it also does not have the shape of a sandwich. Would you really concider a long peace of bread to be like a Sandwich. many come to find that after having a Sanwich and a Hot dog they do not have the same satifaction, sensation, or joy. In the end we see that a Hot Dog has no way of being a Sandwich.  <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/is-the-hot-dog-a-sandwich/" taget="_blank"> Someone elses thoughts</a></p>
