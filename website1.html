        <h2> What I love about it</h2>
        <p>The first thing that sets Brawl Stars apart from a simple game, I would say, is the pressure. You are ONE trophy away from reaching the next level, and then you go back to the beginning. This is the right one, and you get pumped up and start... Once you see the enemy, this isn't a physical fight, it's a mental battle that takes seconds. You see the enemy you are fighting with and you also see your teamates. While you wait see who makes the first move, you analyze your enemy. You or them? The game begins. You play a shoot a shot to charge your super your get it... FIRE. You're happy one dead two to go, but the enemy plays a smart. You analyze what else they could have while your teamates die and when you're going to defend... Boom, dead now you have your super. You wonder how they could dodge this good, but the only important thing is to not give up... That's how all the games are, mental battles that are created in seconds...</p>
